# History notes

## 2026-01-09: commit 3b4b176
Commit message mentions "docs(ui)", but the commit actually introduced:
- UI workbench app (apps/ui-workbench)
- workflows (.github/workflows/ui-check.yml)
- packages/ui-kit
- protocol/agentic-workbench
- standards/qes and standards/training
- tools/ui-preflight.sh and tools/ws-root.sh
- workbench backlog artifacts

If we later want cleaner history, we can rewrite this commit in a coordinated force-push, but for now we preserve stability.
