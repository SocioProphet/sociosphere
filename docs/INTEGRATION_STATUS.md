# Integration Status

This file is the canonical current-state ledger for cross-repo integration
facts that were previously repeated in multiple places.

## Current state

### TritRPC
- Canonical upstream: `https://github.com/SocioProphet/TriTRPC`
- Workspace declaration: `manifest/workspace.toml` repo `tritrpc`
- Materialization path: `third_party/tritrpc`
- Status: active workspace dependency

### Trit-to-Trust
- Status: removed as an independent workspace dependency
- Notes/content: folded into TritRPC docs during de-commingling

## Resolved migration timeline

| Stage | Snapshot |
|---|---|
| Initial coupling | `tritrpc` + `trit-to-trust` tracked together |
| First pinning pass | both pinned at `v0.1.0` |
| Second pinning pass | `tritrpc v0.1.1 @ 6091e55`, `trit-to-trust v0.1.1 @ 68186ab` |
| De-commingled state | TritRPC retained, Trit-to-Trust removed from workspace deps |
| Current steady state | TritRPC remains as standalone core dependency |

## Interpretation rule

If another document references Trit-to-Trust as an active workspace dependency,
treat that content as historical context. Current behavior is defined by
`manifest/workspace.toml` + `manifest/workspace.lock.json`.
